        <h2>Getting Foiling</h2>

        
        <div class = "prequesite">
          <p><b>Prequesite</b> - comfortable using a wing. Once you can sail around on a board across the wind and turn around, it's time to learn to foil!</p>
        </div>
          
        
        <p>The first thing we need to learn when wingfoiling, is how to get up onto the foil. From the Foil Knowledge section, we know that lift is determined by three factors:</p>
          <div class = "sections1">
            <div class = "diagrams">
               <img src="lift_formula.jpg" height="90px" width = "240px"/>
            </div>
              <ol>
                <li><b>Size</b> of the foil</li>
                <li><b>Speed</b> of the foil through the water</li>
                <li><b>Lift Coefficient</b> - (related to the <b>Angle of Attack</b> of the foil)</li>
              </ol>
          </div>

          <p>To lift the rider out of the water requires sufficient speed, <b>lift coefficient</b> and foil size.</p>
        
        

          <h3>Making it easier for Beginners</h3>
          <p>Beginners will find it hard to get up on the foil. They will not have the ability yet to artificially increase speed and reduce drag through pumping. They can however use a big foil (1700-2500cm2) to help them, and go out in plenty of wind (15kts+) to push them along at a sufficient speed.</p>


          <h3>Getting the board foiling</h3>

          <h4>Pop up speed (the speed at which we bring the board out of the water)</h4>

          <p>Pop-up is the acton of accelerating with the board in the water, then putting a little extra backfoot pressure to bring the board out of the water.</p>
          <p>For Beginners, they won't actively do this at first, see the exercise below.</p>

          <p>Remember from the Foil Knowledge section that drag vs speed looks like this:</p>

          <div class="sections1">
            <div class = "diagrams">
              <img src = "popupspeed.jpg" width="400px" height="250px" />
            </div>
          </div>

          <p>This graph comes into effect once the rider is out of the water. The high drag at slow speeds is caused by a high Angle of Attack. So if we try and pop the board out of the water at too low a speed, drag is very high.</p>
          <div class="sections1">
            <div class = "diagrams">
              <img src = "highdrag.jpg" width="150px" height="112px" />
            </div>
            <div>
            <p>Trying to pop up at too slow a speed is a very common mistake that beginners and intermediates make. They come out of the water a bit, with a very high nose, then instantly lose speed and lift.</p>
            <p>Even if we aren't yet popping up, if we have the nose too high, both the drag from the foil and the tail of the board reduce our speed, making it impossible to lift up.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          
          
          <div class="sections1">
            <div class = "diagrams">
              <img src = "lowdrag.jpg" width="150px" height="112px" />
            </div>
            <div>
            <p>So it is better to gain more speed on the surface of the water with the board almost flat, then pop up. BOARD FLAT is key!</p>
            
            <p>For ultimate refinement, the optimum Angle of Attack is about 5degrees nose up, where the lift:drag ratio is at it's maximum. This still feels pretty flat.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          
          <p>The other major advantage of gaining more speed before popping up is that the foil will be more stable when you do pop up - essential for beginners. Beginners can just let the foil come up without actively trying to pop it up, meaning they don't have to move their weight around, making it a lot easier.</p>

          <h3><span style="color: #0073ff"><b>Practical Exercise</b></span> - Beginners getting foiling</h3>

          <p>At first, we want to get board speed with the board still on the water.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Have the wing in the correct position, with the board pointing across the wind</li>
            <li>As you accelerate, keep your weight on your front foot - this keeps the BOARD FLAT</li>
            <li>As the foil starts to lift, the board feels lighter. This is less stable than when the board was going slower, but not quite as unstable as it will be when the board is fully out of the water. So practice this for a while until comfortable. </li>
            <li>When comfortable with the board semi-foiling, it's time to </li>
          </ol>

          <p></p>

          

          <h4>Pumping the Wing</h4>
          <p>Pumping the wing will increase the speed of the board, and generate more lift from the foil.</p>
          <p>It is best done in a circular motion (this can depend on the make of wing). The key is that you feel you are pulling yourself forward and gaining speed.</p>

          <h4>Pumping the Board</h4>

          <p>Once we can get the board foiling by keeping the board flat, we can look to get onto the foil in lighter winds. We do this by pumping.</p>
          
          <p>Pumping has two effects: </p> 
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>Reducing the board drag. By popping the board higher, displacement drag is momentarily reduced (less of the board is in the water)</p>
              <p>This means that speed increases, increasing foil lift</p>
              </li>
            <li>
              <p>Converting height into forward speed - we lift ourselves out of the water, then we convert that height into speed by gliding forward.</p>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>This is made much better by timing the wing pump so that you are pulling the board forward when it is at it's highest in the pump. This gives you the biggest speed boost</p>

            <li>Pumping both board and wing help massively getting the board foiling.</li>
