        <h2>Getting Foiling</h2>

        <p>There are plenty of wingfoil technique articles on the web. However, they don't focus on why they work </p>
        
        <p>The first thing we need to learn when wingfoiling, is how to get up onto the foil. From the Foil Knowledge section, we know that lift is determined by three factors:</p>
          <div class = "sections1">
            <div class = "diagrams">
               <img src="lift_formula.jpg" height="90px" width = "240px"/>
            </div>
              <ol>
                <li><b>Size</b> of the foil</li>
                <li><b>Speed</b> of the foil through the water</li>
                <li><b>Lift Coefficient</b> - (related to the <b>Angle of Attack</b> of the foil)</li>
              </ol>
          </div>

          <p>To lift the rider out of the water requires sufficient speed, <b>lift coefficient</b> and foil size.</p>
        
        

          <h3>Making it easier for Beginners</h3>
          <p>Beginners will find it hard to get up on the foil. They will not have the ability yet to artificially increase speed and reduce drag through pumping. They can however use a big foil (1700-2500cm2) to help them, and go out in plenty of wind (15kts+) to push them along at a sufficient speed.</p>


          <h3>Getting the board foiling in lighter winds</h3>

          <p>With better balance, riders are able to pump the board, to get it foiling in lighter winds. The rider can pump both the board and the wing to help them get up onto the foil</p>

          <p>Before we look at pumping, let's look at the process of getting a board onto the foil:</p>

          <ol>
            <li>The wing pulls the rider forward</li>
            <li>The drag is initially from the board ploughing through the water (displacement drag). This is low at very low speeds, but increases with speed.</li>
            <li>This increasing drag is somewhat reduced by foil producing some lift, which reduces the effective weight of board+rider, reducing the displacement drag</li>
            <li>If the power of the wing is enough to overcome the displacement drag, the board will accelerate</li>
            <li>A big foil at this point will be producing enough lift to bring the board out of the water</li>
            <li>If using a small foil, the board may start semi-planing before there is enough speed to lift out of the water</li>
          </ol>

          <h4>Pop up speed (the speed at which we bring the board out of the water)</h4>

          <p>Remember from the Foil Knowledge section that drag vs speed looks like this:</p>

          <div class="sections1">
            <div class = "diagrams">
              <img src = "popupspeed.jpg" width="400px" height="300px" />
            </div>
          </div>

          <p>Remember that this graph only applies once the rider is out of the water, and that the high drag at slow speeds is caused by a high Angle of Attack. This graph is very important when getting foiling. If we try and pop the board out of the water at too low a speed, drag is very high.</p>
          <p>Trying to pop up at too slow a speed is a very common mistake that beginners and intermediates make. They come out of the water a bit, with a very high nose, then instantly lose speed and lift.</p>
          <p>Even if we aren't yet popping up, if we have the nose too high, both the drag from the foil and the tail of the board reduce our speed, making it impossible to lift up.</p>
          <p>So it is better to gain more speed on the surface of the water with the board almost flat, then pop up. BOARD FLAT is key!</p>
          <p>For ultimate refinement, the optimum Angle of Attack is about 5degrees nose up, where the lift:drag ratio is at it's maximum. This still feels pretty flat.</p>
          

          <h4>Pumping the Wing</h4>
          <p>Pumping the wing will increase the speed of the board, and generate more lift from the foil.</p>
          <p>It is best done in a circular motion</p>

          <h4>Pumping the Board</h4>
          <p>We can also pump the board. What we are doing here is reducing the board drag. By popping the board higher, displacement drag is momentarily reduced (less of the board is in the water)</p>
          <p>This means that speed increases, increasing foil lift</p>
          <p>This is made much better by timing the wing pump so that you are pulling the board forward when it is at it's highest in the pump.</p>
          

          <h2>Summary</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Beginners need big foils and lots of wind</li>
            <li>To get going in lighter winds:
              <ul>
                <li>Keep the board flat and gain good speed on the surface of the water before popping up</li>
                <li>Pumping both board and wing help massively getting the board foiling</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
