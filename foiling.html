        <h2>Getting Foiling</h2>

        
        <div class = "prequesite">
          <p><b>Prerequisite</b> - comfortable using a wing. Once you can sail around on a board across the wind and turn around, it's time to learn to foil!</p>
        </div>

        <div class = "conditions">
          <p><b>Conditions</b> - Flat Water and Wind - gusts of 15kts to 25kts</p>
        </div>
          
        
        <p>Having mastered sailing around off the foil, the first thing we need to learn when wingfoiling is how to get up onto the foil. The biggest hurdle for beginners is generating enough lift</p>
          <p>From the Foil Knowledge section, we know that lift is determined by three factors:</p>
          
              <ol>
                <li><b>Size</b> of the foil</li>
                <li><b>Speed</b> of the foil through the water</li>
                <li><b>Lift Coefficient</b> - (related to the <i>Angle of Attack</i> of the foil)</li>
              </ol>
          

          <p>So, to lift the rider out of the water requires sufficient speed, lift coefficient and foil size.</p>
        
        

          <h3>Making it easier for Beginners</h3>
          <p>Beginners will find it hard to get up on the foil. They will not have the ability yet to artificially increase speed and reduce drag through pumping. They can however use a big foil (1700-2500cm2) to help them, and go out in plenty of wind (15kts+) to push them along at a sufficient speed.</p>
          <p>Flat water also makes it a lot easier. 15kts on the open sea will generate chop, so look for harbours, lakes or reservoirs to start with</p>

          <h2><span style="color: #ff0000">Common Errors</span></h2>

          <h4>Pop up speed too slow (the speed at which the board comes out of the water)</h4>

          <p>Pop-up is the action of accelerating with the board in the water, then putting a little extra backfoot pressure to bring the board out of the water.</p>

          <p>Remember from the Foil Knowledge section that drag vs speed looks like this:</p>

          <div class="sections1">
            <div class = "diagrams">
              <img src = "popupspeed.jpg" width="370px" height="295px" />
            </div>
          </div>

          <p>With the board in the water, some of the weight is supported by buoyancy, but as soon as the board lifts off the water this graph comes into effect. </p>
          <p>The high drag at slow speeds is caused by a high Angle of Attack. So if we try and pop the board out of the water at too low a speed, drag is very high.</p>
        
          <div class="sections1">
            <div>
              <p>Trying to pop up at too slow a speed is a very common mistake that beginners and intermediates make. They come out of the water a bit, with a very high nose, then instantly lose speed and lift.</p>
              <p>Even if we aren't yet popping up, if we have the nose too high, both the drag from the foil and the tail of the board reduce our speed, making it impossible to lift up.</p>
              </div>
            <div class = "diagrams_centre">
              <img src = "highdrag.jpg" width="150px" height="112px" />
            </div>
            
          </div>
          

          
          
          <div class="sections1">
            <div class = "diagrams">
              <img src = "lowdrag.jpg" width="150px" height="112px" />
            </div>
            
            <p>So it is better to gain more speed on the surface of the water with the board almost flat, then pop up. BOARD FLAT is key!</p>
            
          </div>

            <p>For ultimate refinement, the optimum Angle of Attack is about 5degrees nose up, where the lift:drag ratio is at it's maximum. This still feels pretty flat.</p>
       
          <p>The other major advantage of gaining more speed before popping up is that the foil will be more stable when you do pop up - essential for beginners. Beginners can just let the foil come up without actively trying to pop it up, meaning they don't have to move their weight around, making it a lot easier.</p>

          <h4>Foil setup poorly</h4>

          <p>If the foil is setup incorrectly then two things can happen:</p>
          <ol>
            <li class="listmargin">If the foil is too far back in the box, the rider can semi-foil, but not get the board out of the water</li>
            <li class="listmargin">If the foil is too far forward in the box, the rider will not be able to keep the board flat as there is too much NOSE UP</li>
          </ol>

          <p>See: <a href="foilsetup.html" class="bottomlink">Foil Setup</a> for more details</p>


          <h3><span style="color: #0073ff"><b>Practical Exercises</b></span> - Beginners getting foiling</h3>

          <h4><span style="color: #0073ff">Exercise 1</span> - Semi-Foiling</h4>
          <p>At first, we want to get board speed with the board still on the water.</p>

          <p>A recap from the Knowledge pages - control of the pitch of the board:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Leaning our <b>weight forward</b> pushes the <b>nose down</b></li>
            <li>Leaning our <b>weight backward</b> brings the <b>nose up</b></li>
          </ul>

          <ol>
            <li class = "listmargin">Have the wing in the correct position, with the board pointing across the wind</li>
            <li class = "listmargin">As you accelerate, keep your weight on your front foot - this keeps the BOARD FLAT</li>
            <li class = "listmargin">As the foil starts to lift, the board feels lighter. This is less stable than when the board was going slower, but not quite as unstable as it will be when the board is fully out of the water. So practice this for a while until comfortable. </li>
            <li class = "listmargin">To come to a stop, de-power the wing and put your weight on your front foot. BEWARE - you will not stop instantly so plan ahead!</li>
          </ol>

            <ol>
              <li class = "listmargin">Try to accelerate to a slightly faster speed than Exercise 1, still keeping the board flat. This extra speed should be enough to bring you out of the water.</li>
              <li class = "listmargin">A tiny bit of back foot pressure might help, but if you need any more than this then you are going too slowly.</li>

            <h2>Refinements - Stance and Pumping</h2>

            <h4>Stance</h4>

            <p>When first learning, the riders stance tends to be quite hunched over:</p>

            <div class = sections1>
            <div class = "diagrams_pic">
              <img src = "stance_wrong.jpg" width="150px" height="150px" />
            </div>
            <p>Incorrect stance, with bent back, bottom sticking out and shoulders forward</p>
            
            </div>

            <p>Instead, the correct stance will make control easier and muscle fatigue less likely:</p>
          
            <div class = sections1>
            <div class = "diagrams_pic">
              <img src = "stance_correct.jpg" width="150px" height="150px" />
            </div>
            <p>Correct stance, with straight back in line with the foil and shoulders back</p>
            </div>

            

          

          <h4>Pumping the Wing</h4>
          <p>Pumping the wing will increase the speed of the board, and generate more lift from the foil.</p>
          <p>It is best done in a circular motion (this can depend on the make of wing). The key is that you feel you are pulling yourself forward and gaining speed.</p>

          <h4>Pumping the Board</h4>

          <p>Once we can get the board foiling by keeping the board flat, we can look to get onto the foil in lighter winds. We do this by pumping.</p>
          
          <p>Pumping has two effects: </p> 
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>Reducing the board drag. By popping the board higher, displacement drag is momentarily reduced (less of the board is in the water)</p>
              <p>This means that speed increases, increasing foil lift</p>
              </li>
            <li>
              <p>Converting height into forward speed - we lift ourselves out of the water, then we convert that height into speed by gliding forward.</p>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>This is made much better by timing the wing pump so that you are pulling the board forward when it is at it's highest in the pump. This gives you the biggest speed boost</p>
