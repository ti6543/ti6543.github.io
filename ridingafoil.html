        <h2>Riding a foil</h2>
        
        <p>On this page we'll look at how a foil is controlled by the rider</p>
        <p>To recap, lift is determined by the following:</p>

        <div class = "diagrams">
            <img src = "lift_formula.jpg" width="200px" height="100px" />
        </div>

        <p>And secondly that lift is controlled by the rider by changing the Angle of Attack:</p>

        <div class = "diagrams">
          <img src = "AoA2.jpg" width="200px" height="100px" />
        </div>

      <p>Lift must always be equal to rider weight. At low speeds, we therefore need a high Angle of Attack. At higher speeds, the Angle of Attack is reduced.</p>

      <div class = "sections1">
      <div class = "diagrams">
        <img src = "Man_slow.png" width="180px" height="150px" />
        <p>Slow speed and high Angle of Attack</p>
      </div>
      <div class = "diagrams">
        <img src = "Man_fast.png" width="180px" height="150px" />
        <p>High speed and low Angle of Attack</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2>The effect of speed on the balance point</h2>

    <div class="sections1">
      <div class = "diagrams">
        <img src = "highspeed.jpg" width="300px" height="300px" />
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>We've just seen that the foil will have a lower Angle of Attack at increased speed. </p>
        <p>However, because the stabiliser is upside down, any decrease in Angle of Attack on the front wing INCREASES Angle of Attack on the stabiliser.</p>
        <p>This increases the downward lift, which shifts the balance point forward. As a consequence the rider needs to have their weight further foward at higher speeds.</p>
        <p>The foil setup (fuselage length, stabiliser size, shim) will affect how far forward the rider will need to move their weight at higher speeds. More on this later.</p>
        
      </div>
      
    </div>

    <h4>Drag pitch down effect:</h4>
    <div class="sections1">
      <div class = "diagrams">
        <img src = "rotate_stab_drag.jpg" width="300px" height="250px" />
      </div>
      <div>
    <p>At higher speeds, the drag of the foil adds a nose down, the opposite effect to the stabiliser.</p>
    <p>Generally the nose up effect of the stabiliser is larger than the nose down effect of drag, but this is not always the case</p>
    <p>Some setups can become very front footed at high speed, some can stay almost neutral. Neutral setups are great for wave riding.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <h2>Putting it altogether</h2>
    
    <p>To control the foil, the rider needs to control both:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The upward lift. This is done by changing the angle of attack on the front foil</li>
      <li>The rotational forces. This is done by adjusting weight forward and aft</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Fortunately, both of these require moving the rider weight forward at higher speeds, and back at lower speeds.</p>
