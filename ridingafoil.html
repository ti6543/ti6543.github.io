        <h2>Riding a foil</h2>
        
        <p>On this page we'll look at how a foil is controlled by the rider</p>
        <p>To recap, lift is determined by the following:</p>

        <div class = "diagrams">
            <img src = "lift_formula.jpg" width="200px" height="100px" />
        </div>

        <p>And secondly that lift is controlled by the rider by changing the Angle of Attack:</p>

        <div class = "diagrams">
          <img src = "AoA2.jpg" width="200px" height="100px" />
        </div>

      <p>Lift must always be equal to rider weight. At low speeds, we therefore need a high Angle of Attack. At higher speeds, the Angle of Attack is reduced.</p>

      <div class = "sections1">
      <div class = "diagrams">
        <img src = "Man_slow.png" width="180px" height="150px" />
        <p>Slow speed and high Angle of Attack</p>
      </div>
      <div class = "diagrams">
        <img src = "Man_fast.png" width="180px" height="150px" />
        <p>High speed and low Angle of Attack</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2>The effect of speed on the balance point</h2>

    <h4>Stabiliser effect</h4>

    <div class="sections1">
      <div class = "diagrams">
        <img src = "highspeed.jpg" width="300px" height="300px" />
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>We've just seen that the foil will have a lower Angle of Attack at increased speed. </p>
        <p>However, because the stabiliser is upside down, any decrease in Angle of Attack on the front wing INCREASES Angle of Attack on the stabiliser.</p>
        <p>This, combined with extra speed, increases the downward lift. This creates an extra nose up rotation.</p>
        <p>The foil setup (fuselage length, stabiliser size, shim) will affect how strong this effect is. More on this later.</p>
        
      </div>
      
    </div>

    <h4>Drag pitch down effect:</h4>
    <div class="sections1">
      <div class = "diagrams">
        <img src = "rotate_stab_drag.jpg" width="300px" height="250px" />
      </div>
      <div>
    <p>As mentioned on the previous page, the drag of the foil creates a nose down rotation, the opposite effect to the stabiliser.</p>
    <p>This increases with the square of speed.</p>
    
      </div>
    </div>

    <h4>Centre of pressure changes:</h4>

    <p>The centre of pressure of a foil is where the lift comes from.</p>

    <div class="sections1">
      <div class = "diagrams">
        <img src = "highspeed_CofP.jpg" width="300px" height="250px" />
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>As the Angle of Attack changes on the front foil, the centre of pressure changes.</p>
        <p>The centre of pressure moves rearward at higher speeds.</p>
        <p>The effect of this is to increase the nose down rotation force.</p>
        <p>Near the stall (slow speed), the opposite happens and nose down rotation is reduced. You have probably noticed that as you approach the stall foils tend to pitch the nose even higher, just before all lift is lost.</p>
        <p>The profile of the foil will determine how strong this effect is. More on this later</p>
    
      </div>
    </div>

    <h4>Total effect on the balance point:</h4>
    <p>Stabiliser - nose UP at higher speeds</p>
    <p>Drag - nose DOWN at higher speeds</p>
    <p>CofP - nose DOWN at higher speeds</p>

    <p>The type of foil and the setup will determine exactly how the balance point changes at low and high speed.</p>


    <h2>Putting it altogether</h2>
    
    <p>To control the foil, the rider needs to control both:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The upward lift. This is done by changing the angle of attack on the front foil</li>
      <li>The rotational forces. This is done by adjusting weight forward and aft. The foil shape and setup will affect how much the weight must be adjusted.</li>
    </ol>
