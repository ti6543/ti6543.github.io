        <h2>How a foil is controlled</h2>
        
        <p>On this page we'll look at how a foil is controlled by the rider</p>

        <p>We saw on the last page that the rider needs to control both the overall upward lift, and the nose up/down forces from the foil (and its drag).</p>
        <p>We'll look at how the foil changes the <i>Balance Point</i> at different speeds. First a recap.</p>


        <div class = "diagrams">
          <img src = "LiftWeight.jpg" width="300px" height="250px" />
        </div>

        
        

        <h4>Recap: Overall Upward Lift</h4>

        <p>Without any rider correction, lift increases with speed</p>
        
      <p>In order to compensate for changing speed, the <i>Angle of Attack</i> is adjusted. At low speeds, we therefore need a high <i>Angle of Attack</i>. At higher speeds, the <i>Angle of Attack</i> is reduced.</p>

      <div class = "sections1">
      <div class = "diagrams">
        <img src = "Man_slow.png" width="180px" height="150px" />
        <p>Slow speed and high Angle of Attack</p>
      </div>
      <div class = "diagrams">
        <img src = "Man_fast.png" width="180px" height="150px" />
        <p>High speed and low Angle of Attack</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h4>Recap: Rotational forces</h4>

    

    
      <div class = "diagrams">
        <img src = "foil7.jpg" width="400px" height="300px" />
        
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>My moving the bodyweight, the rider can control the NOSE UP/DOWN rotation</p>
        <p>When the bodyweight is in the correct position, known as the <i>Balance Point</i>, there is no NOSE UP/DOWN rotation</p>
      </div>
    
      <div class="gap"></div>

    <h2>The effect of speed on the balance point</h2>

    <p>The <i>Balance Point</i> of the setup will change with speed.</p>
    <p>This means that the rider has to shift their bodyweight to match the changing <i>Balance Point</i></p>
    <p>The change of <i>Balance Point</i> is dictated by the stabiliser, the drag, plus any changes in the lift position of the front foil:</p>


    <h4>Stabiliser effect</h4>

    <div>
      <div class = "diagrams">
        <img src = "highspeed.jpg" width="220px" height="220px" />
      </div>
      
        <p>We've just seen that the front foil will have a lower Angle of Attack at increased speed. </p>
        <p>However, because the stabiliser is upside down, any decrease in Angle of Attack on the front wing INCREASES the Angle of Attack on the stabiliser.</p>
        <p>This, combined with extra speed (squared), increases the downward lift. This creates an extra nose up rotation.</p>
        <p>The foil setup (fuselage length, stabiliser size, shim) will affect how strong this effect is. More on this later.</p>
        
      </div>
      
    
      
    <h4>Drag pitch down effect:</h4>

    <div>
      <div class = "diagrams">
        <img src = "rotate_stab_drag.jpg" width="240px" height="200px" />
      </div>
      
    <p>As mentioned on the previous page, the drag of the foil creates a nose down rotation, the opposite effect to the stabiliser.</p>
    <p>This increases with the square of speed.</p>
    <p>This opposes the stabiliser. The stabiliser increase at high speed is larger however, due to the effect of both speed and <i>Angle of Attack</i></p>
    
      
    </div>

    <h4>Centre of pressure changes:</h4>

    <p>The centre of pressure (<i>CofP</i>) of the front foil is where the lift comes from.</p>

    
      <div class = "diagrams">
        <img src = "highspeed_CofP.jpg" width="300px" height="250px" />
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>As the Angle of Attack changes on the front foil, the centre of lift changes.</p>
        <p>The centre of lift moves forward at low speeds. The effect of this is to increase the NOSE UP rotation force.</p>
        <p>You have probably noticed that just before you stall a foil it tends to pitch the nose even higher.</p>
        <p>The profile of the foil will determine how strong this effect is. More on this later</p>
    
      
    </div>

    <h4>Total effect on the balance point:</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>Stabiliser - nose UP at higher speeds</li>
    <li>Drag - nose DOWN at higher speeds</li>
    <li><i>CofP</i> - nose UP at lower speeds, especially near the stall. </li>
    </ul>

    <p>The type of foil and the setup will determine exactly how the balance point changes at low and high speed.</p>
    <p>For example, a setup with a big stabiliser might induce nose UP at high speed</p>
    <p>However a foil that has a backward <i>CofP</i> effect at higher speeds combined with a smaller stabiliser might  be nose DOWN at high speed</p>

    <div class="gap"></div>

    
    
    

    <div class = "summary">
      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The rider controls overall upward lift by adjusting <i>Angle of Attack</i>, and NOSE UP/DOWN rotation by moving their bodyweight forward or back</li>
        <li>If the rider is ahead of the <i>Balance Point</i> the nose sinks, if behind the nose rises</li>
        <li>The <i>Balance Point</i> can change with speed, caused by the changes in stabiliser lift, drag and Centre of Pressure movement on the front foil. The rider must shift their bodyweight to compensate </li>
