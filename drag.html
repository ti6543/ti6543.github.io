        <h2>Drag</h2>

        <p>Foils produce drag when going through the water. There are two types of drag that affect foils:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Parasitic drag - this is the drag caused by the resistance of the water. It increases as the square of the speed. </li>
          <li>Induced drag - this is the drag cause by creating lift, which induces vortices. This is bigger at high Angles of Attack (slow speeds) </li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>Total drag is the combination of the two:</p>

        <div class="sections1">
        <div class = "diagrams">
          <img src = "drag.jpg" width="300px" height="250px" />
      </div>
      <p>From the graph we can see that there is a moderate speed at which drag is at a minimum. We call this Minimum-Drag speed. This speed is the most efficient and requires the least amount of power from the sail/wing or wave. If you are doing a low power activity like pump-foiling, you will want to do it at this speed.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Stable and unstable speed</h3>

    <p>We call the plot of total drag against speed the "drag curve":</p>
    

    

    <div class="sections1">
      <div class = "diagrams">
        <img src = "speedstableunstable.jpg" width="400px" height="300px" />
      </div>
    <div>
      <p style="text-align:center">Because of the shape of the drag curve, we can break it down into two regions:</p>
      <ol>
          <li class = "listmargin"><span style="color: #ff0000"><b>SPEED UNSTABLE</b></span> - here, any decrease in speed increases drag. This could be from some chop, or a wind lull. This results in a further loss of speed, which again increases drag, leading to a stall. (The only way to recover from this is a big increase in power)</li>
          <li class = "listmargin"><span style="color: #02c505"><b>SPEED STABLE</b></span> - here, a decrease in speed reduces drag, so less power is needed to maintain the new speed. When up on the foil we always want to be riding in the speed stable region. At these speeds, any small reduction in power and/or speed will result in a stable lower speed. </li>
        </ol>
        
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Lift:drag ratio and Takeoff</h2>

    <p>An important foil characteristic is it's lift:drag ratio. That is how much drag it ends up creating per unit of lift</p>
    
    <div class="sections1">
      <div class = "diagrams">
        <img src = "lift_drag.jpg" width="300px" height="300px" />
      </div>
      <div>
      <p>This graph shows how lift:drag ratio changes with Angle of Attack, when up on the foil</p>
      <p>At very high speeds Angle of Attack is low, but parasitic drag is very high</p>
      <p>At Minimum-Drag speed, we are at L/d max, the maximum lift per unit of drag</p>
      <p>At low speeds we are at higher Angles of attack and induced drag is high</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h3>Takeoff</h3>

    <p>In order to takeoff, we need enough lift to counter the weight of the rider</p>

    <p>Takeoff involves</p>

    <h4>High power situation</h4>
    <p>With lots of power, takeoff is easy. We accelerate to a fast speed whilst still on the water, ending up at a speed above minimum-drag. By this point we are creating enough lift to get out of the water, and we rise up. The speed in in the stable region.</p>

    <h4>Low power</h4>
    <p>With low power, things become a lot harder.</p>

    <p>From the lift equation, to takeoff we need a combination of:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Size</li>
      <li>Lift Coefficient</li>
      <li>Speed</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Size - Bigger foils create more lift, so a bigger foil will require less speed to foil</p>
    <p>Lift Coefficient - at first glance, the best strategy may seem to be to angle the board to make the Angle-of-Attack the stall angle, to create the most lift. However this creates a lot of drag.</p>
    <p>A better strategy is to </p>
