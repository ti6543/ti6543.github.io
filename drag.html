        <h2>Drag</h2>

        <p>Foils produce drag when going through the water. There are two types of drag that affect foils:</p>
        
          <h4>1. Parasitic drag</h4>
             <p>This is the drag caused by an object ploughing through water. A bigger frontal area (cross-section) of the foil will increase this, so thick large foils will have more than small thin ones. It increases as the square of the speed. </p>
             <div class = "diagrams">
              <img src = "cross_section.jpg" width="300px" height="150px" />
              
          </div>

          <h4>2. Induced drag</h4>
            <p>This is the drag caused by creating lift, which induces vortices. Creating lift means that there is a low pressure area above the foil, and a high pressure area beneath. At the wingtips, the high pressure water tries to move to the low pressure area. This circular motion of water extends backward behind the foil, and causes drag. </p>
              
            <div class = "diagrams">
              <img src = "Wake_Turbulence.jpg" width="300px" height="240px" />
              
          </div>
              
              <p>This effect is bigger at high Angles of Attack (slow speeds): </p>
        
          <div class="sections1">
            <div class = "diagrams">
              <img src = "vortices_low.png" width="200px" height="170px" />
              <p>Small wingtip vortices at low Angle of Attack</p>
          </div>
          <div class = "diagrams">
            <img src = "vortices_high.png" width="200px" height="170px" />
            <p>Large wingtip vortices at high Angle of Attack</p>
        </div>
          
        </div>
        
        <p>When we add the two together we get Total drag:</p>

        
        <div class = "diagrams">
          <img src = "drag.jpg" width="300px" height="250px" />
      </div>
      <div>
      <p>This graph of Total Drag vs Speed is very important for foiling. </p>
      <p>Drag is high at both very low speeds, and very high speeds.</p>
      <p>There is a moderate speed at which drag is at a minimum. We call this Minimum-Drag speed. This speed is the most efficient and requires the least amount of power from the sail/wing or wave. If you are doing a low power activity like pump-foiling, you will want to do it at this speed.</p>
    </div>
        

    <h3>Stable and unstable speed</h3>

    <p>We call the plot of total drag against speed the "drag curve":</p>
    

    

    
      <div class = "diagrams">
        <img src = "speedstableunstable.jpg" width="300px" height="220px" />
      </div>
    <div>
      <p style="text-align:center">Because of the shape of the drag curve, we can break it down into two regions:</p>
      <ol>
          <li class = "listmargin"><span style="color: #ff0000"><b>SPEED UNSTABLE</b></span> - here, any decrease in speed increases drag. This could be from some chop, a wind lull or doing a manoeuvre . This results in a further loss of speed, which again increases drag, leading to a stall. (The only way to recover from this is a big increase in power). These speeds should always be avoided.</li>
          <li class = "listmargin"><span style="color: #02c505"><b>SPEED STABLE</b></span> - here, a decrease in speed reduces drag, so less power is needed to maintain the new speed. When up on the foil we always want to be riding in the speed stable region. At these speeds, any small reduction in power and/or speed will result in a stable lower speed. </li>
        </ol>
        
      </div>
    

    <h2>Comparing Drag</h2>

    <p>Smaller foils will produce less lift, as well as less drag</p>
    <p>This chart shows the drag at varying speed, for two foils:</p>
    
    
      <div class = "diagrams">
        <img src = "drag_at_speeds.jpg" width="400px" height="200px" />
      </div>
      
      <p>We can see that:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The smaller foil has a higher Minimum-Drag speed</li>
        <li>A smaller foil has less drag at higher speeds, so it can go faster, for the same amount of power</li>
        <li>However, at low speeds, the bigger foil has less drag. This can be important for use in slow waves (e.g. windswell downwinding)</li>
      </ul>

      
      

    <div class = "summary">
      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>There are two types of drag, induced and parasitic</li>
        <li>Induced drag dominates at low speeds, parasitic at high speeds</li>
        <li>Drag is at it's lowest at a moderate speed (for the foil), called Minimum-Drag speed</li>
        <li>At speeds below Minimum-Drag, the speed is UNSTABLE, meaning a rapid loss of speed is likely</li>
        <li>Thick foils with large wingspans have bigger parasitic drag</li>
        <li>Higher Aspect ratios reduce induced drag</li>
        <li>Smaller foils have less drag at higher speeds, but more drag at low speeds</li>
      </ul>
