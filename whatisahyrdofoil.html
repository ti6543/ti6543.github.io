        <h1>What is a hydrofoil?</h1>
        <p>On this page we'll explore the basics of how a hydrofoil works. Simply, a hydrofoil is a wing shape that produces lift (and drag) when moving through water:</p>

        <div class = "diagrams">
          <img src = "Aerofoil1.jpg" width="300px" height="150px" />
        </div>

        

        
          <p>The amount of lift it creates is dependent on three things:</p>
          
              <ol>
                <li><b>Size</b> of the foil</li>
                <li><b>Speed</b> of the foil through the water</li>
                <li><b>Lift Coefficient</b> - (related to the <i>Angle of Attack</i> of the foil)</li>
              </ol>
        
              <p>The Centre of Pressure is the position on the foil of the Lift</p>
        
        <div class="gap"></div>
        
        <h3>1. Size</h3>
        
        
        <div class="sections1">
          <div class = "diagrams_centre_noborder">
            <img src="foil_sizes.png" height="120px" width = "120px"/>
          </div>
          <div>
          <p>A bigger foil will provide more lift than a smaller one, or alternatively it will provide the same lift as a smaller foil, but at a lower speed.</p>
          <p>Size is the area of the foil, viewed from above, measured in cm<sup>2</sup>. Typical sizes range from small race foils of 300cm<sup>2</sup>, up to large pump foils of 2000cm<sup>2</sup> or more. </p>
          
          </div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="gap"></div>
        
          <h3>2. Speed</h3>

          <div class="sections1">
            <div class = "diagrams_centre_noborder">
          <img src = "speed_icon.png" height="100px" width="100px"/>
            </div>
            <div>
              <p>A hydrofoil produces more lift at faster speeds. </p>
              <p>Lift increases with the square of the speed, so going twice as fast results in four times as much lift.</p>
            </div>
          </div>


          <div class="gap"></div>
        
        <h3>3. Lift Coefficient</h3>

        <p>The <i>Lift Coefficient</i> tells us how lift changes with <i>Angle of Attack</i></p>
        <p>The <i>Angle of Attack</i> is the angle between the foil and the incoming water flow:</p>

        <div class = "diagrams">
        <img src = "AngleofAttack.jpg" height = "160px" width = "360px" />
        </div>

        <p>As <i>Angle of Attack</i> increases, more lift is produced. However, there is a limit to this. At an <i>Angle of Attack</i> of between 10 and 20 degrees (depending on the foil), it can no longer produce more lift with increasing <i>Angle of Attack</i>, and lift starts decreasing. This is know as a stall.</p>
        <p>This is a chart of <i>Lift Coefficient</i> versus <i>Angle of Attack</i>, for a foil that stalls at 15 degrees:</p>

        <div class = "diagrams">
        <img src = "AoA2.jpg" height = "200px" width = "340px" />
        </div>

        <p>The shape of the foil determines the shape of this graph, and how it rides. </p>
          
        <p>For example, a thicker foil will have a higher <i>Lift Coefficient</i> at the same <i>Angle of Attack</i> compared to a thin foil. This difference can be quite substantial. More on this in <a href="foilshapessizes.html" class="bottomlink" >Foil Shapes and Sizes</a></p>

        <div class="gap"></div>
      
        <h2>Controlling Lift</h2>

        <p>We always need the foil to be producing the correct amount of lift, equal to the weight of the rider. Too little lift and we sink back down to the water, whilst too much results in us flying up into the air (breaching).</p>

        <div class = "diagrams">
          <p><b>Lift = Weight</b></p>
          <img src = "LiftWeight_hydro.jpg" height = "260px" width = "260px" />
          
          </div>

          <h4>Speed vs Lift Coefficient</h4>

        <p>We don't just foil at one speed - Lift needs to equal weight at different speed. However, without changing anything, more speed equals more lift, and less speed means less lift.</p>
        <p>To compensate, the rider keeps total lift constant by varying the <i>Angle of Attack</i> to control the <i>Lift Coefficient</i> . At slow speeds a large <i>Angle of Attack</i> is required, and at high speeds a low <i>Angle of Attack</i>. So as a foil accelerates, the rider is required to lower the nose of the board to maintain the correct amount of lift.</p>

        <div id = "slowfast">
          <div class = "diagrams">
                <img src = "Man_slow.png" height="120px" width="152px"/>
                <p>Slow - high <i>Angle of Attack</i></p>
          </div>
          <div class = "diagrams">
            <img src = "Man_fast.png" height="120px" width="152px"/>
            <p>Fast - low <i>Angle of Attack</i></p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>The rider will do this instinctively. It happens as follows:</p> 

        <ol>
          <li>The rider goes a bit faster. This extra speed equals extra lift, so Lift is bigger than Weight</li>
          <li>Consequently this pushes the rider higher. They can feel and see this, so:</li>
          <li>They put momentary pressure on the front foot to lower the nose slightly, reducing <i>Angle of Attack</i></li>
          <li>The reduced <i>Angle of Attack</i> means that Lift now equals Weight</li>
        </ol>

        <p>They do the opposite if they slow down, increasing <i>Angle of Attack</i></p>

        <h4>High Speed control</h4>
        <p><i>Angle of Attack</i> is finely controlled by the rider. Too much and the foil produces too much lift</p>
        <p>Because lift increases as the square of speed, controlling the foil by adjusting <i>Angle of Attack</i> becomes much harder at high speed (for the foil) </p>
        <p>For example, at 10kts changing the <i>Angle of Attack</i> by 1 degree might change Lift by 10%. But at 20kts, changing <i>Angle of Attack</i> by 1 degree changes Lift by 40%.</p>
        <p>So, at 20kts the rider must be 4 times more precise with their <i>Angle of Attack</i> than at 10kts</p>
        <p>There comes a speed where <i>Angle of Attack</i> control requires such accuracy it becomes impossible, even for the most gifted of riders</p>
        

        <h4>Foil Size vs Speed</h4>

        <p>We've seen already that smaller foils produce less lift that bigger ones.</p>
        <p>If Size becomes smaller, speed must increase to produce enough lift (for the same <i>Angle of Attack</i>) </p>
        <p>Smaller foils will:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Increase stall speed</li>
          <li>Allow higher speeds before High Speed Control becomes an issue</li>
        </ul>

       <div class = "summary">
        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Lift increases with speed, foil size and Angle of Attack (up to the stall)</li>
          <li>If speed increases, the rider has to reduce the Angle of Attack to keep the lift equal to their weight</li>
        </ul>
