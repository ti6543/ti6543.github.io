        <h1>What is a hydrofoil?</h1>
        <p>On this page we'll explore the basics of how a hydrofoil works. Simply, a hydrofoil is a wing shape that produces lift (and drag) when moving through water:</p>

        <div class = "diagrams">
          <img src = "Aerofoil1.jpg" width="200px" height="100px" />
        </div>

        

        
          <p>The amount of lift it creates is dependent on three things:</p>
          <div class = "sections1">
            <div class = "diagrams">
               <img src="lift_formula.jpg" height="90px" width = "200px"/>
            </div>
              <ul>
                <li><b>Size</b> of the foil</li>
                <li><b>Speed</b> of the foil through the water</li>
                <li><b>Lift Coefficient</b> - (related to the <i>Angle of Attack</i> of the foil)</li>
              </ul>
          </div>
        
        <div class="gap"></div>
        
        <h3>Size</h3>
        
        
        <div class="sections1">
          <div class = "diagrams">
            <img src="foil_sizes.png" height="160px" width = "160px"/>
          </div>
          <div>
          <p>A bigger foil will provide more lift than a smaller one, or alternatively it will provide the same lift as a smaller foil, but at a lower speed.</p>
          <p>Size is the area of the foil, viewed from above, measured in cm<sup>2</sup>. Typical sizes range from small race foils of 300cm<sup>2</sup>, up to large pump foils of 2000cm<sup>2</sup> or more. </p>
          
          </div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="gap"></div>
        
          <h3>Speed</h3>

          <div class="sections1">
          <img src = "speed_icon.png" height="100px" width="100px"/>

            <div>
              <p>A hydrofoil produces more lift at faster speeds. </p>
              <p>Lift increases with the square of the speed, so going twice as fast results in four times as much lift.</p>
            </div>
          </div>


          <div class="gap"></div>
        
        <h3>Lift Coefficient</h3>

        <p>The <i>Lift Coefficient</i> tells us how lift changes with <i>Angle of Attack</i></p>
        <p>The <i>Angle of Attack</i> is the angle between the foil and the incoming water flow:</p>

        <div class = "diagrams">
        <img src = "AngleofAttack.jpg" height = "100px" width = "260px" />
        </div>

        <p>As <i>Angle of Attack</i> increases, more lift is produced. However, there is a limit to this. At an <i>Angle of Attack</i> of between 10 and 20 degrees (depending on the foil), it can no longer produce more lift with increasing <i>Angle of Attack</i>, and lift starts decreasing. This is know as a stall.</p>
        <p>This is a chart of <i>Lift Coefficient</i> versus <i>Angle of Attack</i>, for a foil that stalls at 15 degrees:</p>

        <div class = "diagrams">
        <img src = "AoA2.jpg" height = "200px" width = "340px" />
        </div>

        <p>The shape of the foil determines the shape of this graph, and how it rides. </p>
          
        <p>For example, a thicker foil will have a higher <i>Lift Coefficient</i> at the same <i>Angle of Attack</i> compared to a thin foil. This difference can be quite substantial. More on this in <a href="foilshapessizes.html" >Foil Shapes and Sizes</a></p>

        <div class="gap"></div>
      
        <h2>Controlling the foil</h2>

        <p>We always need the foil to be producing the correct amount of lift, equal to the weight of the rider. Too little lift and we sink back down to the water, whilst too much results in us flying up into the air (breaching).</p>
        <p>This lift needs to be constant at different speeds. However, without changing anything, more speed equals more lift, and less speed means less lift.</p>
        <p>To compensate, the rider keeps total lift constant by varying the <i>Angle of Attack</i> to control the <i>Lift Coefficient</i> . At slow speeds a large <i>Angle of Attack</i> is required, and at high speeds a low <i>Angle of Attack</i>. So as a foil accelerates, the rider is required to lower the nose of the board to maintain the correct amount of lift.</p>

        <div id = "slowfast">
          <div class = "diagrams">
                <img src = "Man_slow.png" height="150px" width="180px"/>
                <p>Slow - high <i>Angle of Attack</i></p>
          </div>
          <div class = "diagrams">
            <img src = "Man_fast.png" height="150px" width="180px"/>
            <p>Fast - low <i>Angle of Attack</i></p>
          </div>
        </div>

       <p>Because lift increases as the square of speed, controlling the foil by adjusting <i>Angle of Attack</i> becomes much harder at high speed (for the foil), as the adjustments to Angle of Attack become much finer. Using a smaller foil makes controlling higher speeds easier.</p>

       <div class = "summary">
        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Lift increases with speed, foil size and Angle of Attack (up to the stall)</li>
          <li>If speed increases, the rider has to reduce the Angle of Attack to keep the lift equal to their weight</li>
        </ul>
