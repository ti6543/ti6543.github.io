        <h2>What is a hydrofoil?</h2>
        <p>A hydrofoil is an object that produces a lift force when passing through water:</p>

        <div class = "diagrams">
          <img src = "Aerofoil1.jpg" width="300px" height="150px" />
        </div>

        <p>A consequence of producing lift is that it also induces drag (more on this later)</p>

        <p>How much lift it creates is dependent on three things:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Size and shape</b> of the foil</li>
            <li><b>Speed</b> of the foil through the water</li>
            <li><b>Angle of Attack</b> of the foil</li>
        </ol>
        
        <div class = "sections">
        <h3>1. Size and shape</h3>
        
        
        <div class = "sections1">
          <div class = "diagrams">
            <img src="foil_sizes.png" height="160px" width = "160px"/>
          </div>
          <p>A bigger and fatter foil will provide more lift than a smaller thinner one.</p>
        </div>
        </div>

        <div class = "sections">
          <h3>2. Speed</h3>
          <p>A hydrofoil produces more lift at faster speeds. Lift is proportional to the square of the speed, so going twice as fast results in four times as much lift</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class = "sections">
        <h3>3. Angle of Attack</h3>

        <p>The angle of attack is the angle between the foil and the incoming water flow:</p>

        <div class = "diagrams">
        <img src = "AngleofAttack.jpg" height = "100px" width = "260px" />
        </div>

        <p>As Angle of Attack increases, more lift is produced. However, there is a limit to this. At around 15 degrees the foil can no longer produce more lift with increasing Angle of Attack, and it starts decreasing. This is know as a stall.</p>
        
        <div class = "diagrams">
        <img src = "AoA2.jpg" height = "260px" width = "500px" />
        </div>
      </div>
      
        <h2>Controlling the foil</h2>

        <p>We always need the foil to be producing the correct amount of lift, at a range of speeds. Too little and we sink back down to the water, whilst too much results in us flying up into the air (breaching).</p>
        <p>The rider will control the amount of lift by varying the Angle of Attack. At slow speeds a high Angle of Attack is required, and at high speeds a low Angle of Attack</p>

        <div id = "slowfast">
          <div class = "diagrams">
                <img src = "Man_slow.png" height="150px" width="180px"/>
                <p>Slow - high Angle of Attack</p>
          </div>
          <div class = "diagrams">
            <img src = "Man_fast.png" height="150px" width="180px"/>
            <p>Fast - low Angle of Attack</p>
          </div>
