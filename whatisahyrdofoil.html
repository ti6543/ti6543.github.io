        <h2>What is a hydrofoil?</h2>
        <p>A hydrofoil is a wing shape that produces lift (and drag) when passing through water:</p>

        <div class = "diagrams">
          <img src = "Aerofoil1.jpg" width="200px" height="100px" />
        </div>

        

        
          <h4>The amount of lift it creates is dependent on three things:</h4>
          <div class = "sections1">
            <div class = "diagrams">
               <img src="lift_formula.jpg" height="90px" width = "240px"/>
            </div>
              <ul>
                <li><b>Size</b> of the foil</li>
                <li><b>Speed</b> of the foil through the water</li>
                <li><b>Lift Coefficient</b> - (related to the <b>Angle of Attack</b> of the foil)</li>
              </ul>
          </div>
        
        
        <div class = "sections">
        <h3>Size</h3>
        
        
        <div class = "sections1">
          <div class = "diagrams">
            <img src="foil_sizes.png" height="160px" width = "160px"/>
          </div>
          <p>A bigger foil will provide more lift than a smaller one.</p>
        </div>
        </div>

        <div class = "sections">
          <h3>Speed</h3>
          <p>A hydrofoil produces more lift at faster speeds. Lift is proportional to the square of the speed, so going twice as fast (without changing <b>Angle of Attack</b>) results in four times as much lift.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class = "sections">
        <h3>Lift Coefficient</h3>

        <p>The <b>Lift Coefficient</b> tells us how lift changes with <b>Angle of Attack</b></p>
        <p>The <b>Angle of Attack</b> is the angle between the foil and the incoming water flow:</p>

        <div class = "diagrams">
        <img src = "AngleofAttack.jpg" height = "100px" width = "260px" />
        </div>

        <p>As <b>Angle of Attack</b> increases, more lift is produced. However, there is a limit to this. At an <b>Angle of Attack</b> of between 10 and 20 degrees (depending on the foil), it can no longer produce more lift with increasing <b>Angle of Attack</b>, and it starts decreasing. This is know as a stall.</p>
        <p>This is a chart of <b>Lift Coefficient</b> versus <b>Angle of Attack</b>, for a foil that stalls at 15 degrees:</p>

        <div class = "diagrams">
        <img src = "AoA2.jpg" height = "260px" width = "500px" />
        </div>

        <p>The shape of the foil determines the shape of this graph, and how it rides. More on this in Foil Shapes/Sizes</p>

      </div>
      
        <h2>Controlling the foil</h2>

        <p>We always need the foil to be producing the correct amount of lift, equal to the weight of the rider. This needs to be at a range of speeds. Too little lift and we sink back down to the water, whilst too much results in us flying up into the air (breaching).</p>
        <p>The rider controls the amount of lift by varying the <b>Angle of Attack</b>. At slow speeds a large <b>Angle of Attack</b> is required, and at high speeds a low <b>Angle of Attack</b>. So as a foil accelerates, the rider is required to lower the nose of the board to maintain constant lift.</p>

        <div id = "slowfast">
          <div class = "diagrams">
                <img src = "Man_slow.png" height="150px" width="180px"/>
                <p>Slow - high <b>Angle of Attack</b></p>
          </div>
          <div class = "diagrams">
            <img src = "Man_fast.png" height="150px" width="180px"/>
            <p>Fast - low <b>Angle of Attack</b></p>
          </div>
        </div>

       <p>Because lift increases as the square of speed, controlling the foil by adjusting <b>Angle of Attack</b> becomes much harder at high speed (for the foil), as the adjustments to Angle of Attack become much finer. Using a smaller foil makes controlling higher speeds easier.</p>
