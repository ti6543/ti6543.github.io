        <div class="prequesite" >
            <p><b>Prerequisite</b> - comfortable sailing switch-stance</p>
            </div>

            <div class = "conditions">
              <p><b>Conditions</b> - Flat Water and Wind - gusts of 14kts to 25kts</p>

            <h2><span style="color: #ff0000">Common Errors</span> - Coping with High Apparent Wind</h2>
            

            <p>Like gybing, Apparent Wind plays a cruical role in this move. However, instead of it reducing, it increases, because we are turning upwind:</p>
            <div class = "diagrams">
              <img src = "Apparent_wind_UW.jpg" width="300px" height="250px" />
            </div>

            <p>This increase in Apparent wind in the tack is the biggest factor when people struggle with them</p>
            <p>The mistake people make when tacking is leaving their front hand over their head, rather than getting it as far away from the body as possible. These diagrams explain:</p>
            <p>Wrong:</p>
            <div class = "diagrams">
                <img src="Tack_wrong.jpg" height="320px" width = "370px"/>
             </div>
    
             <p>Correct:</p>
             <div class = "diagrams">
                <img src="Tack_right.jpg" height="320px" width = "370px"/>
             </div>

             <p>So by getting the drag away from the body, it aids the turn, rather than hindering it.</p>

            <h2><span style="color: #0073ff"><b>Toeside Tack</b></span></h2>

            <p>It is easier to start with the toeside (switch-stance) tack.</p>

            <ol>
              <li>Sail across the wind with good speed, switch-stance. The more speed, the more likely a foiling exit</li>
              <li>Put pressure on your toes, to carve into the wind. Start off with a gentle carve. You are unlikely to foil out, but have more time to practice the correct technique</li>
              <li>Keep your weight forward. This is critical, as the increased apparent wind will try to push you onto your back foot, leading to a breach</li>
              <li>Take your back hand off the wing, and pass your front hand over your head. Try to get your hand as low and far away from your body as possible.
            

           

          
        </li>
        <li>Try and power the wing up on the new tack as soon as possible</li>
        <li>Once comfortable, you can tighten up the turn to make a foiling exit more likely</li>
        </ol>

        <div class = "summary">
          <h2>Summary</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>The big problem with learning to tack is to deal with the increased Apparent Wind</li>
            <li>By shifting the wing as far across the body as possible, the extra Apparent wind aids the turn, rather than hinders it</li>
