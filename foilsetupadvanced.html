        <h2>Foil setup (Advanced)</h2>

        <p>On the foil setup page, we saw how to set up the board and foil so that it is balanced for cruising speed, giving a comfortable ride. We can however change various aspects of the setup to change how a foil rides</p>

        <p>We're not going to look at the effect of changing the front foil yet, but will in later pages</p>

        <h2>Pitch stability</h2>

        <p>Pitch stability is three things:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>How much of a bodyweight shift is required to pitch up or down</li>
          <li>How quickly the board will pitch up or down if bodyweight is in the wrong position</li>
          <li>How much the foil setup will try to return to where it was after hitting turbulence</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Beginners will want good pitch stability, as they won't be as accurate and quick in shifting their bodyweight.</p>
        <p>More advanced riders will want to be able to adjust their pitch more easily, to cope better with a rider range of speeds</p>

        <p>You can increase stability by using:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Longer fuselages</li>
          <li>Bigger stabilisers</li>
          <li>Negative shim</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Alternatively, to loosen up the pitch stability you can do the opposite, using shorter fuselages and smaller stabilisers</p>

        <h2>Reducing drag</h2>

        <p>For maximum efficiency, we want to reduce drag. This is best done by reducing stabiliser size. </p>
        <p>Stabilisers with negative shim also produce more drag, so these can be eliminated</p>
        <p>By doing this, you're going to reduce NOSE UP pressure, so will have to rectify it with either:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Moving the track forward in the box</li>
          <li>Using a longer fuselage (this can add a tiny amount of drag too)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Maneuverability</h2>

        <p>The foil is turned on two axis. Generally a turn will involve some yaw and roll.</p>

        <h3>Roll and Yaw</h4>

          <div class = "diagrams">
            <img src = "Roll_yaw.jpg" width="200px" height="200px" />
          </div>

        <h3>Stabiliser properties</h3>

        <h4>Upturned tips</h4>

        <p>Some stabilisers are flat, and some have upturned wings</p>

        <p>These upturned tips resist yaw. This can </p>

        <h4>Dihedral</h4>
        
        <p>Dihedral is the angle the two wings of the stabiliser make to each other.</p>

        <p>When roll is applied, the lower wing will have more upward lift than the tilted one. This </p>

        <p>It will also resist roll induced yaw as well</p>

        <p>Dihedral reduces the maneuverability of the setup, but increases the roll stability - if you try to roll it will resist</p>
        


        <h3>Fuselage length</h3>

        <p>By reducing fuselage length, maneuverability is increased</p>
        
        <h2>Pumping</h2>

        <h3>Balance point vs speed</h3>
        <p>From earlier, we learnt that the balance point shifts at low and high speeds</p>

        <h4>Stabiliser</h4>
        <p>As speed increases, the stabiliser produces more downward lift, lifting the nose UP. This is both due to extra speed (speed squared), and extra Angle of Attack </p>


        <h4>Drag</h4>
        <p>Drag increases due to extra speed, pushing the nose DOWN. The effect is purely proportional to the square of speed. Because of this, it won't be as big an effect as the stabiliser</p>

        <h4>Centre of Pressure change</h4>

        <p>At low speed the centre of pressure can move forward</p>

        <div class="sections1">
          <div class = "diagrams">
            <img src = "highspeed_CofP.jpg" width="300px" height="250px" />
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>The movement is small, maybe only 1-2cm. However, because the rider may only be standing a few centimetres ahead of the CofP of the front wing, the relative change can be large.</p>
        <p>The profile of the foil changes how far the CofP moves, and at what speed</p>
        
        <h3>Overall Effect</h3>

        <p>The overall effect of these three interactions will depend on the </p>

        <p>NOSE UP at high speed - for this </p>
