        <h2>Foil setup (Advanced)</h2>

        <p>On the foil setup page, we saw how to set up the board and foil so that it is balanced for cruising speed. We can however change various aspects of the setup to change how it rides</p>

        <p>From earlier, we learnt that the balance point shifts at low and high speeds</p>

        <h4>Stabiliser</h4>
        <p>As speed increases, the stabiliser produces more downward lift, lifting the nose UP. This is both due to extra speed (speed squared), and extra Angle of Attack </p>


        <h4>Drag</h4>
        <p>Drag increases due to extra speed, pushing the nose DOWN. The effect is purely proportional to the square of speed. Because of this, it won't be as big an effect as the stabiliser</p>

        <h4>Centre of Pressure change</h4>

        <p>At low speed the centre of pressure can move forward</p>

        <div class="sections1">
          <div class = "diagrams">
            <img src = "highspeed_CofP.jpg" width="300px" height="250px" />
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>The movement is small, maybe only 1-2cm. However, because the rider may only be standing a few centimetres ahead of the CofP of the front wing, the relative change can be large.</p>
        <p>The profile of the foil changes how far the CofP moves, and at what speed</p>
        


        <h4>Stable (Beginner) setup</h4>
        <p>For this we have a setup with:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Big stabiliser (relative to front foil)</li>
            <li>Long Fuselage</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This setup means a cruising balance point that is far ahead of the front wing.</p>
        <p>Pros:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>If the rider has their weight in slightly the wrong place, any change in pitch is slow and recoverable</li>
        <li>CofP is further from the balance point. Therefore any movement means a small change in leverage</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Cons:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>At higher speeds, the stabiliser overwhelms the setup, lifting the nose too much to keep control</li>
        <li>Maneuverability is low</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Advanced setup</h4>
        <p>For this we need:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Small stabiliser (relative to front foil)</li>
            <li>Short Fuselage</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This setup means a cruising balance point that is close to the front wing.</p>
        <p>Pros:</p>
        <p>More maneuverable</p>
        <p>Easier to control higher speeds (the stabiliser has less lift)</p>
        <p>Cons:</p>
        <p>CofP changes are relatively bigger so have a bigger effect</p>
        
        
        <h3>High speed setup</h3>

        <p>If we're having a session where we expect to be going faster than we normally would (e.g. high wind winging), then we know that the balance point will be further forward than normal. This may make our riding stance uncomfortable as our weight is so far forward. To compensate, we can move the mast further back in the track, or try and reduce the lift from the stabiliser (use a smaller stabiliser and/or positive shim). </p>

        <p>On the next page you can play with changing various foil setups to see how the balance point is affected.</p>
