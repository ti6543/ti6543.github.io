        <h2>Foil setup (Advanced)</h2>

        <p>On the foil setup page, we saw how to set up the board and foil so that it is balanced for cruising speed, giving a comfortable ride. We can however change various aspects of the setup to change how a foil rides.</p>

        <p>We're not going to look at the effect of changing the front foil yet, but will in later pages</p>

        <div class="smallgap"></div>

        <h2>Pitch stability</h2>

        <p>Pitch stability is three things:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>How much of a bodyweight shift is required to pitch up or down</li>
          <li>How quickly the board will pitch up or down if bodyweight is in the wrong position</li>
          <li>How much the foil setup will try to return to where it was after hitting turbulence</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Beginners will want strong pitch stability, as they won't be as accurate and quick in shifting their bodyweight.</p>
        <p>More advanced riders will want to be able to adjust their pitch more easily, to cope better with a rider range of speeds</p>

        <p>You can increase stability by using:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Longer fuselages</li>
          <li>Bigger stabilisers</li>
          <li>Negative shim</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This will require moving the mast backward in the foil box</p>

        <p>Alternatively, to loosen up the pitch stability you can do the opposite, using shorter fuselages and smaller stabilisers. This will require moving the mast forward in the foil box</p>

        <div class="smallgap"></div>

        <h2>Reducing drag</h2>

        <p>For maximum efficiency, we want to reduce drag. This is best done by reducing stabiliser size. </p>
        <p>Stabilisers with negative shim also produce more drag, so these can be eliminated</p>
        <p>By doing this, you're going to reduce NOSE UP pressure, so will have to rectify it with either:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Moving the track forward in the box</li>
          <li>Using a longer fuselage (this can add a tiny amount of drag too)</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="smallgap"></div>

        


        <h2>Balance point vs speed</h2>
        <p>From earlier, we learnt that the <i>Balance Point</i> shifts at low and high speeds</p>

        <p>For most applications, we want to make the <i>Balance Point</i> shift as little as possible over a wide range of speeds. The exception is freestyle, where extra NOSE UP at higher speeds can help with jumping.</p>

        <h4>Stabiliser</h4>
        <p>As speed increases, the stabiliser produces more downward lift, lifting the nose UP. This is both due to extra speed (speed squared), and also extra Angle of Attack. </p>


        <h4>Drag</h4>
        <p>Drag increases due to extra speed, pushing the nose DOWN. The effect is purely proportional to the square of speed. Because of this, it won't be as big an increase as the stabiliser at high speed</p>

        <h4>Centre of Pressure change</h4>

        <p>At low speed the centre of pressure can move forward</p>

        <div class="sections1">
          <div class = "diagrams">
            <img src = "highspeed_CofP.jpg" width="300px" height="250px" />
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>The movement is roughly 1/4 to 1/2 the chord of the foil, depending on the foil design. However, because the rider may only be standing a few centimetres ahead or behind the CofP of the front wing, the relative change can be substantial.</p>
        <p>The profile of the foil changes how far the CofP moves, and at what speed</p>
        
        
        <h4>Overall Effect</h4>

        <p>The overall effect of these three interactions will affect how the <i>Balance Point</i> shifts at low and high speed</p>

        <p>Stabiliser effects will come into play at high speeds. Centre of Pressure changes are mainly dominant at low speeds, but can play a role over the entire speed range.</p>

        <div class="smallgap"></div>

        <h2>Changing Front Foil size</h2>

        <h4>Foil Geometry</h4>
        <p>Often you'll have a complete setup, but want to add an extra foil from the range.</p>

        <p>It's not always obvious what this will do to the <i>Balance Point</i>. Depending on how the foil is constructed, the CofP can move forward or back: </p>

        <div class = "diagrams">
          <img src = "changingfrontfoil.jpg" width="450px" height="370px" />
        </div>

        <p>So for the range on the left, a smaller foil moves the <i>Balance Point</i> forward, but for the one on the right it moves it back.</p>

        <p>Some brands have designed their foils so the Centre of Pressure of the front wing doesn't move (relative to the fuselage) across their range</p>

        <h4>Stabiliser and Drag effect</h4>
        <p>As an example, imagine we have a 1500cm<sup>2</sup> front foil, a fuselage and a stabiliser from a certain brand. We now buy a 1000cm<sup>2</sup> foil to add to it. What is the effect on the <i>Balance Point</i>?</p>
        <p>If we cruise at the same <i>Angle of Attack</i> (which means a faster speed given the smaller front foil):</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Stabiliser - extra downward lift (NOSE UP) due to extra speed (speed squared). <i>Angle of Attack</i> is the same.  </li>
          <li>Drag - extra NOSE DOWN due to extra speed (speed squared). However the foil is smaller with less overall drag, so the NOSE DOWN effect is smaller than the increase in stabiliser NOSE UP. </li>
          <li>Stabiliser+Drag - so the combination of these two is slightly more NOSE UP (<i>Balance Point</i> forward)</li>
          <li>Centre of Pressure - depending on the diagram above, it might move forward, back or stay neutral</li>
        </ol>

        <p>So overall, with a neutral brand you might have to move the foil backward slightly in the box. However, the geometry of the foil brand could either add or subtract to this effect.</p>

        <div class = "summary">
          <h2>Summary</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Pitch stability is increased with bigger stabilisers, negative shim and longer fuselages</li>
            <li>Drag is minimised with smaller stabilisers and positive shim</li>
            <li>The <i>Balance Point</i> shift at different speeds is a function of stabiliser, drag and Centre of Pressure movements </li>
            <li>Changing to a smaller front foil on a setup should require a slight adjustment back in the foil box, but this is very foil geometry dependent</li>
          </ul>
