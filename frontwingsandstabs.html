        <h2>Front Wings and Stabilisers</h2>
        <p>A foiling setup consists of three parts (plus a mast to connect it to the board)</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Front wing - this is a hydrofoil that lifts upward</li>
            <li>Stabiliser - this is a smaller hydrofoil that is upside down, and makes the foil setup more stable. It typically lifts downward (though not high Angle of Attack)</li>
            <li>Fuselage - this connects the front wing to the back wing</li>
        </ul>

        <p>On the last page we saw that foil upward lift always needs to be constant to keep the rider aloft and steady</p>
        <p>Upward lift isn't the only consideration. Now we also need to think about rotational forces. These are felt by the rider as the nose of the board either pitching up or down. </p>
        <p>The rider is typically ahead of both the front wing and stabiliser. Because of this, both these hydrofoils will try and rotate the setup, but in opposite directions:</p>

            <p>The front wing tries to rotate the setup to pitch down</p>

            <p>The stabiliser tries to rotate the setup to pitch up</p>

            <img src = "foil3.jpg" width="200px" height="100px" />
            <p>The size of the rotational forces is lift force multiplied by distance from hydrofoil to rider</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>For every given configuration, there is position that the rider must stand for the two forces to be equal - and a stable ride</p>
        <p>We call this the balance point. It will change with different foil setups, and also at different speeds.</p>
