        <h2>Front Wings and Stabilisers</h2>
        <p>A foiling setup consists of three parts (plus a mast to connect it to the board)</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Front wing - this is a hydrofoil that lifts upward</li>
            <li>Stabiliser - this is a smaller hydrofoil that is upside down, and makes the foil setup more stable. It typically lifts downward (depending on <b>Angle of Attack</b>)</li>
            <li>Fuselage - this connects the front wing to the back wing</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Rotational Forces</h3>

        <p>On the last page we saw that foil upward lift always needs to be constant to keep the rider aloft. Upward lift isn't the only consideration however - we also need to think about rotational forces. These are felt by the rider as the nose of the board either pitching up or down. </p>
        
        
        <p>The rider is normally ahead of both the front wing and stabiliser. Because of this, both the front foil and stabiliser will try and rotate the setup, but in opposite directions:</p>
        
        <div class = "sections1">
          <div class = "diagrams">
            <img src = "foil4.jpg" width="200px" height="150px" />
            <p>The front wing tries to rotate the setup to pitch down</p>
          </div>

            <p>The stabiliser tries to rotate the setup to pitch up</p>
          </div>

          

          
        </div>

        <h4>Bodyweight movement</h4>

        <div class="sections1">
          <div class = "diagrams">
            <img src = "foil6.jpg" width="300px" height="250px" />
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>By moving their body forward or aft, the leverage (force x distance) of the stabiliser and front wing changes.</p>
        
        <p>If the rider has their bodyweight back, the nose down leverage from the front wing is small. This means a net NOSE UP effect.</p>
        <p>If the rider has their bodyweight forward, the nose down leverage from the front wing increase more than the nose up leverage from the stabiliser. This means a net NOSE DOWN effect.</p>

        <h4>Drag nose down effect</h4>

        <div class="sections1">

            <img src = "drag_rotation.jpg" width="300px" height="200px" />
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>The effect of drag is to rotate the nose down</p>
        
        <p>Because the rider is far above the foil, any drag rotates the setup NOSE DOWN. You may have noticed this effect when foiling and you pick up some weed (adding hugh amounts of drag)</p>

        <h4>The Balance Point</h4>

            <img src = "foil7.jpg" width="400px" height="200px" />
            <p>The balance point - all rotations cancel each other out</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            
        
            <p>There is position that the rider needs to stand for the nose up and nose down leverages to be equal, so that the board stays level.</p>
            <p>We call this the <b>Balance Point</b>. It will change with different foil setups, and also at different speeds. Importantly there are various means to change the position of the balanced point so that the rider can stand in a comfortable position, more in Foil Setup.</p>

      <h3>Why do we have a stabiliser?</h3>

      
        <h4>Weight shift stability</h4>
        <p>If we had no stabiliser, the rider must position their weight with pinpoint accuracy. If the rider is in the wrong place by a tiny amount, the setup rapidly pitches up or down. By having a fuselage and stabiliser, the rider weight can be in the wrong place and the pitch change is a lot slower, giving them time to readjust their weight. Bigger stabilisers and longer fuselages make the setup more stable.   </p>
        <h4>Turbulence stability</h4>
        <p>Imagine a rider is foiling along totally balanced, but hits a bit of turbulence that changes the <b>Angle of Attack</b>. This has an opposite effect on the Front foil and Stabiliser, meaning the setup tries to pitch back to where it was. For example, if the turbulence increases the overall <b>Angle of Attack</b>, the front foil produces more lift, and the stabiliser less lift. Because the front foil pitches nose down, and the stabiliser nose up, this rotates the foil setup back to where it was.</p>
