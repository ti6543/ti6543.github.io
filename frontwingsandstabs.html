        <h2>Front Wings and Stabilisers</h2>
        <p>A foiling setup consists of three parts (plus a mast to connect it to the board)</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Front wing - this is a hydrofoil that lifts upward</li>
            <li>Stabiliser - this is a smaller hydrofoil that is upside down, and makes the foil setup more stable. It typically lifts downward (though not high Angle of Attack)</li>
            <li>Fuselage - this connects the front wing to the back wing</li>
        </ul>

        <div class = "diagrams">
          <img src = "foil2.jpg" width="300px" height="150px" />
        </div>

        <p>On the last page we saw that foil upward lift always needs to be constant to keep the rider aloft and steady</p>
        <p>Upward lift isn't the only consideration. Now we also need to think about rotational forces. These are felt by the rider as the nose of the board either pitching up or down. </p>
        <p>The rider is typically ahead of both the front wing and stabiliser. Because of this, both these hydrofoils will try and rotate the setup, but in opposite directions:</p>
        
        <div class = "sections1">
          <div class = "diagrams">
            <img src = "foil4.jpg" width="200px" height="100px" />
            <p>The front wing tries to rotate the setup to pitch down</p>
          </div>

          <div class = "diagrams">
            <img src = "foil5.jpg" width="200px" height="100px" />
            <p>The stabiliser tries to rotate the setup to pitch up</p>
          </div>

          <div class = "diagrams">
            <img src = "foil3.jpg" width="200px" height="100px" />
            <p>The size of the rotational forces is lift force multiplied by distance from hydrofoil to rider</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>For every given configuration, there is position that the rider must stand for the two forces to be equal - and a stable ride</p>
        <p>We call this the balance point. It will change with different foil setups, and also at different speeds.</p>

            <p>The balance point</p>
          </div>


      

      <h2>Why do we have a stabiliser?</h2>

      
        <h3>Weight shift stability</h3>
        <p>If we had no stabiliser, the rider must position their weight very accurately over the centre of lift of the front wing. If the rider is in the wrong place by a tiny amount, the setup rapidly pitches up or down. By having a fuselage and stabiliser, the rider weight can be in the wrong place and the pitch change is a lot slower, giving them time to readjust their weight. Bigger stabilisers and longer fuselages make the setup more stable.   </p>
        <h3>Turbulence stability</h3>
        <p>Imagine a rider is foiling along totally balanced, but hits a bit of turbulence that changes the Angle of Attack. This has an opposite effect on Front Wing and Stabiliser, meaning the setup tries to pitch back to where it was. For example, if the turbulence increases the overall Angle of Attack, the front wing produces more lift, and the stabiliser less lift. Because the front wing pitches nose down, and the stabiliser nose up, this rotates the foil setup back to where it was.</p>
