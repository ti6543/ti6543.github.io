        <h2>Front Wings and Stabilisers</h2>
        <p>A foiling setup consists of three parts (plus a mast to connect it to the board)</p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Front Foil</b> - this is a hydrofoil that lifts upward</li>
            <li><b>Stabiliser</b> - this is a smaller hydrofoil that is upside down, and makes the foil setup more stable. It typically lifts downward at moderate and higher speeds, but can lift upward at very low speeds.</li>
            <li><b>Fuselage</b> - this connects the front wing to the back wing</li>
        </ul>

        <div class = "diagrams">
          <img src = "foil2.jpg" width="300px" height="150px" />
        </div>

        <div class="gap"></div>

        <h3>Rotational Forces</h3>

        <p>On the last page we saw that the size of the foil upward lift always needs to be equal to rider weight to keep them aloft.</p>
        <p>The size of the upward lift isn't the only consideration however. We also need to consider where the position of the lift is, as it can be ahead or behind the rider: </p>
        
          <div class="sections1">
        <div class = "diagrams">
          <img src = "LiftWeight_fwd.jpg" width="250px" height="250px" />
          <p>Lift forward of weight</p>
        </div>
        <div class = "diagrams">
          <img src = "LiftWeight_back.jpg" width="250px" height="250px" />
          <p>Lift aft of weight</p>
        </div>
          </div>

          <p>So whenever the Lift is forward of the weight, the nose tries to rise (NOSE UP)</p>
          <p>So whenever the Lift is aft of the weight, the nose tries to sink (NOSE DOWN)</p>

          <h3>What determines the position of the Lift?</h3>

          <p>Anything that tries to rotate the NOSE UP is moving the lift forward</p>
          <p>Anything that tries to rotate the NOSE DOWN is moving the lift back</p>

        <h4>Foil and stabiliser lift</h4>
        
        <p>The front foil and stabiliser combined will try and lift the NOSE UP</p>
        <p>This mainly comes from the stabiliser, although the front foil can have an effect too:</p>
        
        <div class="sections1">
          <div class = "diagrams">
            <img src = "foil5.jpg" width="200px" height="200px" />
            <p>The stabiliser typically tries to rotate the setup to pitch up, especially at higher speeds</p>
          </div>

          <div class = "diagrams">
            <img src = "foil4.jpg" width="200px" height="200px" />
            <p>The front foil centre of lift is normally near the riders centre of mass, meaning small pitch effects. In some instances (e.g. low speed) this isn't the case</p>
          </div>

        </div>

          
        <h4>Foil Drag</h4>

        
        <div class = "diagrams">
          <img src = "drag_rotation.jpg" width="300px" height="220px" />
          
        </div>
          
            <p>The effect of drag is to rotate the NOSE DOWN</p>
        
        <p>Because the rider is far above the foil, any drag rotates the setup NOSE DOWN. You may have noticed this effect when foiling and you pick up some weed (adding a huge amounts of drag and adding a big NOSE DOWN effect)</p>
      
        <h4>The Balance Point</h4>
        
        <p>As seen above, the rider needs to stand where the lift is coming from. This position is called the <i>Balance Point</i>.</p>

        <div class = "diagrams">
          <img src = "LiftWeight.jpg" width="400px" height="300px" />
          
        </div>
        <p>The <i>Balance Point</i> will change with different foil positions and setups, and also at different speeds.</p>
          
        
          <div class = "diagrams">
            <img src = "foil7.jpg" width="400px" height="300px" />
            
          </div>
          
            
        
            
            <p>The <i>Balance Point</i> is sometimes called the "centre of lift" of the foil, as it can be thought of as the position on the board where the lift is acting through (and so where the rider must stand)</p>
            <p>If the rider is not in the correct position:</p>

          <div class = "sections1">
            <div class = "diagrams">
                <img src = "man_board1.jpg" width="200px" height="150px" />
                <p>If the balance point is forward of the rider, the nose lifts</p>
              </div>
            <div class = "diagrams">
                <img src = "man_board2.jpg" width="200px" height="150px" />
                <p>If the balance point is behind the rider, the nose drops</p>
            </div>

          </div>
            <p>Importantly there are various means to change the position of the <i>Balance Point</i> so that the rider can stand in a comfortable position, more in <a href="foilsetup.html" >Foil Setup</a></p>
        
        
          
        

        

      <div class="gap"></div>

      <h2>Why do we have a stabiliser?</h2>

      
        <h4>Weight shift stability</h4>
        <p>If we had no stabiliser, the rider must position their weight with pinpoint accuracy. If the rider is in the wrong place by a tiny amount, the setup rapidly pitches up or down. By having a fuselage and stabiliser, the rider weight can be in the wrong place and the pitch change is a lot slower, giving them time to readjust their weight. Bigger stabilisers and longer fuselages make the setup more stable.   </p>
        
        <h4>Turbulence stability</h4>

        <p>Turbulence stability is the ability of the foil to self correct if upset</p>
        
        
        <div>
        <div class = "diagrams">
          <img src = "turbulence.jpg" width="300px" height="400px" />
          
        </div>

        
        <p>Imagine a rider is foiling along totally balanced, but hits a bit of turbulence that changes the <i>Angle of Attack</i>. This has an opposite effect on the Front foil and Stabiliser, meaning the setup tries to pitch back to where it was.</p>
        <p>For example, imagine hitting some turbulence that pitches the nose of the board down. This decreases the <i>Angle of Attack</i> on the front foil, so it produces less lift. The effect on the stabiliser is the opposite, as it is an upside down hydrofoil. So the extra stabiliser downward lift produces a NOSE UP effect. This rotates the foil setup back to where it was.</p>
        
        </div>

        <p>Again, a bigger stabiliser and/or longer fuselage means a bigger correction force, and therefore more stability. </p>

        <div class = "summary">
          <h2>Summary</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>The foil will produce both upward lift, and either a NOSE UP or DOWN rotation</li>
            <li>The foil lift (mainly downward from the stabiliser) adds to the NOSE UP force. The drag from the foil adds to the NOSE DOWN.</li>
            <li>The <i>The Balance Point</i> is where the rider must centre their weight to ensure neither up nor down nose movement</li>
            <li>Stabilisers make the rider more stable in pitch</li>
          </ul>
