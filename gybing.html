        <h2>Gybing</h2>

        <div class="prequesite" >
        <p><b>Prerequisite</b> - once comfortable foiling across the wind, and able to do a non-foiling gybe, it's time to learn the foiling gybe</p>
        </div>

        <div class = "conditions">
          <p><b>Conditions</b> - Flat Water and Wind - gusts of 14kts to 25kts</p>
        </div>

        <p>Learning the foiling gybe can be challenging if not done in a methodical way. You can go for a "gung-ho" approach and just fly in full speed, hoping for the best. The problem with this is that it leads to nasty crashes and the potential for kit damage.</p>

      <p>Fortunately it can be broken into smaller achievable steps, that won't result in horrible crashes.</p>

        <h3>Apparent Wind</h3>

        <p>To understand the gybe, we need to understand Apparent Wind</p>

        <p>Apparent wind is the wind felt by the rider, as they foil along. It is the summation of both the Wind, and the Boardspeed Wind - the wind felt purely by moving.</p>

        <div class="sections1">
            <div class = "diagrams">
              <img src = "Apparent_wind_1.jpg" width="300px" height="250px" />
            </div>
          </div>

          <p>Apparent wind will decrease when going downwind, and increase when going upwind.</p>


        <h3>Going Downwind</h3>


        <p>Before learning to gybe, we need to learn to go downwind.</p>
        <p>This may seem simple, as we can already steer. However, the problem is that as we go further off the wind, the apparent wind reduces.</p>
        

        <div class="sections1">
            <div class = "diagrams">
              <img src = "Apparent_wind_dw.jpg" width="200px" height="250px" />
            </div>

            
          </div>
        
          <p>The issue is that with very small Apparent wind, we have nothing to balance against. This is challenging at first, as we're used to having the power of the wing to lean against.</p>
          <p>Typically what happens when people start learning to gybe is that they get to the point where the Apparent wind becomes small. They then try and sheet in even more to get more power. This doesn't work (it cannot), so they fall in.</p>
          <p>For this reason, before gybing it is essential to be able to go downwind in control, coping with the lack of wing power by balancing purely on the foil</p>

          <h2><span style="color: #0073ff"><b>Foiling Gybe Exercises</b></span></h2>

          <p>Each exercise here will prepare you for the next, and by the time you get to the end you'll be foiling out of gybes</p>
          <p>There shouldn't be any nasty crashes, as these typically come from trying too much, too soon - e.g. trying to gybe without being able to go downwind under control</p>

          <h4>Exercise 1 - Going Downwind</h4>

          <ol>
            <li>Sail at a good speed across the wind</li>
            <li>Put gentle pressure on the ball of your front foot to initiate to turn off the wind. Don't be aggressive, it's harder to stay under control</li>
            <li>At about 30 degrees off the wind you will feel the Apparent wind start to drop. DON'T SHEET IN HARDER!</li>
            <li>Instead, lift the wind above your head, so that it is horizontal. The boom strut should be pointing downwind.</li>
            <li>On your first goes, go to about 60 degrees downwind. Then, if you have enough speed, carve back onto your heels. You will feel instant relief as you go back across the wind, as you have power back in your wing!</li>
            <li>Try and see if you can go almost dead downwind. Then either do a controlled touchdown, or carve back upwind, depending on your speed. Controlled touchdowns are very useful to learn for Exercise 3.</li>
          </ol>

          <p>Exercise 1 with touchdown ending</p>
          </div>

          <h4>Exercise 2 - Going Downwind and releasing the back hand</h4>

          <p>Now we are going to do Exercise 1, but take the back hand off after lifting the wing. This is an essential skill to prepare for changing the hands</p>
          <p>You will need to lean forward when you take the back hand off.</p>

    

          <h4>Exercise 3 - Going through Dead downwind and first dry gybes</h4>

          <p>Once comfortable gliding downwind with no power in the wing and the backhand off, it's time to go further</p>
          <p>Try now to glide a bit further round the turn, going through dead downwind</p>
          <p>Do a controlled touchdown, then switch the hands off the foil</p>
          <p>Come round onto the new tack, across the wind. Then switch the feet.</p>
          <p>Don't be tempted to change the feet before back across the wind, as riding switch stance off the foil for a few seconds will be good practice for when you'll be doing it on the foil in Exercise 5</p>

          <h4>Exercise 4 - Switching hands on the foil</h4>

          <p>As per Exercise 3, but now try to but the new front hand onto the front handle whilst still foiling</p>
          <p>Again, do a controlled touchdown</p>
          <p>If you sheet in at this point and are still foiling, you might make it all the way round the turn</p>

            <p>Exercise 4 with foiling hand switch then touchdown</p>
            </div>


          <h4>Exercise 5 - Foiling exits switch stance</h4>

          <p>Now you can start to exit the turn on the foil</p>
          
          <p>We want to enter the gybe at a good speed. This means a slow deceleration, as we are in the SPEED STABLE region. This gives us a long time to do a gentle turn, and not come off the foil.</p>
          <p>If the gybe entry is too slow, we end up in the SPEED UNSTABLE region, where drag increases as we slow down. This rapidly leads to a stall. It is a common mistake for people to enter too slowly, then struggle to cope in the SPEED UNSTABLE region, where the Balance Point is rapidly shifting. </p>

          </div>


          <ol>
            <li>At first, it's easist to exit quite broad. This makes sailing switch stance easier, as there is less pull across the board</li>
            <li>See how far you can go, and experiment with going a bit more across the wind.</li>
            <li>You will get to the stage where you are comfortable sailing switch stance</li>
            <li>Make sure you don't sheet in too early. If still dead downwind you can switch the hands, but continue to glide. If you try to sheet in there will be no power in the wing.</li>
          </ol>

          <div class = "summary">
            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>The biggest issue people have with gybing is the part of the gybe where there is zero apparent wind:
                <img src = "dont_sheet_in.jpg" width="200px" height="100px" /></li>
                <li>During this part of the gybe we are purely gliding on the foil, so need to be comfortable doing that</li>
                <li>Build up in stages, gliding further and further round the gybe with the power off. The correct technique is the wing sheeted out above the head, with the boom strut horizontal.</li>
                <li>DO NOT SHEET IN DURING THE MIDDLE PART OF THE GYBE</li>
                <li>An entry with speed and a gentle carve is essential</li>
                <li>A slow entry and a hard carve will make it impossible</li>
              
            </ul>
