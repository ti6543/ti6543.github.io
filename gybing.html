        <h2>Gybing</h2>

        <p>Learning to gybe on a wingfoil can be challenging. There are a few issues</p>

        <p>You can go for a "gung-ho" approach and just fly in full speed, hoping for the best. The problem with this is that it leads to nasty crashes and the potential for kit damage.</p>

      <p>Fortunately it can be broken into smaller achievable steps, that </p>

        <h3>Apparent Wind</h3>

        <p>Apparent wind is the wind felt by the rider, as they foil along:</p>

        <div class="sections1">
            <div class = "diagrams">
              <img src = "Apparent_wind_1.jpg" width="300px" height="250px" />
            </div>
          </div>

          <p>Apparent wind will decrease when going downwind, and increase when gonig upwind.</p>

        <h3>Going Downwind</h3>

        <p>Before learning to gybe, we need to learn to go downwind.</p>
        <p>This may seem simple, as we can already steer. However, the problem is that as we go further off the wind, the apparent wind reduces.</p>
        

        <div class="sections1">
            <div class = "diagrams">
              <img src = "Downwind_normal.jpg" width="200px" height="250px" />
            </div>

            <div class = "diagrams">
                <img src = "Downwind_light.jpg" width="200px" height="250px" />
              </div>
          </div>
        
          <p>The issue is that with zero or reversed Apparent Wind, we have nothing to balance against. This is challenging at first, as we're used to having the power of the wing to lean against.</p>

          <p>For this reason, before gybing it is essential to be able to go downwind in control, balancing purely on the foil</p>
