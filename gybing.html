        <h2>Gybing</h2>

        <p>Learning to gybe on a wingfoil can be challenging. There are a few issues</p>

        <p>You can go for a "gung-ho" approach and just fly in full speed, hoping for the best. The problem with this is that it leads to nasty crashes and the potential for kit damage.</p>

      <p>Fortunately it can be broken into smaller achievable steps, that won't result in horrible crashes.</p>

        <h3>Apparent Wind</h3>

        <p>To understand the gybe, we need to understand Apparent Wind</p>

        <p>Apparent wind is the wind felt by the rider, as they foil along. It is the summation of both the Wind, and the Boardspeed Wind - the wind felt purely by moving.</p>

        <div class="sections1">
            <div class = "diagrams">
              <img src = "Apparent_wind_1.jpg" width="300px" height="250px" />
            </div>
          </div>

          <p>Apparent wind will decrease when going downwind, and increase when going upwind.</p>


        <h3>Going Downwind</h3>


        <p>Before learning to gybe, we need to learn to go downwind.</p>
        <p>This may seem simple, as we can already steer. However, the problem is that as we go further off the wind, the apparent wind reduces.</p>
        

        <div class="sections1">
            <div class = "diagrams">
              <img src = "Apparent_wind_dw.jpg" width="200px" height="250px" />
            </div>

            
          </div>
        
          <p>The issue is that with very small Apparent wind, we have nothing to balance against. This is challenging at first, as we're used to having the power of the wing to lean against.</p>
          <p>Typically what happens when people start learning to gybe is that they get to the point where the Apparent wind becomes small. They then try and sheet in even more to get more power. This doesn't work (it cannot), so they fall in.</p>
          <p>For this reason, before gybing it is essential to be able to go downwind in control, coping with the lack of wing power by balancing purely on the foil</p>

          <h2>Gybe Exercises</h2>

          <p>Each exercise here will prepare you for the next, and by the time you get to the end you'll be foiling out of gybes</p>
          <p>There shouldn't be any nasty crashes, as these typically come from trying too much, too soon - e.g. trying to gybe without being able to go downwind under control</p>

          <h4>Exercise 1 - Going Downwind</h4>

          <ol>
            <li>Sail at a good speed across the wind</li>
            <li>Put gentle pressure on the ball of your front foot to initiate to turn off the wind. Don't be aggressive, it's harder to stay under control</li>
            <li>At about 30 degrees off the wind you will feel the Apparent wind start to drop. DON'T SHEET IN HARDER!</li>
            <li>Instead, lift the wind above your head, so that it is horizontal. The boom strut should be pointing downwind.</li>
            <li>On your first goes, go to about 60 degrees downwind. Then, if you have enough speed, carve back onto your heels. You will feel instant relief as you go back across the wind, as you have power back in your wing!</li>
            <li>Try and see if you can go almost dead downwind. Then either do a controlled touchdown, or carve back upwind, depending on your speed.</li>
          
          </ol>

          <h4>Exercise 2 - Going Downwind and releasing the back hand</h4>

          <h4>Exercise 3 - Going through Dead downwind and first dry gybes</h4>

          <h4>Exercise 4 - Switching hands on the foil</h4>

          <h4>Exercise 5 - Foiling exits switch stance</h4>
