        <h2>Foil setup</h2>

        <p>Foilers, especially beginners, are often very confused about how to set up and tune their equipment</p>
        <p>Poorly setup kit will either never get them on the foil, or buck them off immediately. The mast position in the track only needs to be an inch out to result in a very difficult ride.</p>
        <p>Often riders will have managed to learn on slightly out-of-balance kit, but then find it impossible to learn to gybe</p>
        <p>IT CANNOT BE EMPHASISED ENOUGH HOW IMPORTANT THE CORRECT SETUP IS</p>

        <div class="gap"></div>

        <h3>Balance point</h3>

        <p>Remember that previously we said that every combination of front wing, fuselage and stabiliser ( at a given speed) will have a <i>Balance Point</i>. When the rider is above the balance point, the board stays level</p>
        <div class = "sections1">
            <div class = "diagrams">
            <img src = "foil7.jpg" width="400px" height="250px" />
          </div>

        
        

        </div>

<p>If the rider is not in the correct position:</p>

          <div class = "sections1">
            <div class = "diagrams">
                <img src = "man_board1.jpg" width="200px" height="150px" />
                <p>If the balance point is forward of the rider, the nose lifts</p>
              </div>
            <div class = "diagrams">
                <img src = "man_board2.jpg" width="200px" height="150px" />
                <p>If the balance point is aft  of the rider, the nose drops</p>
            </div>

          </div>

        <h4>Balance point at varying speeds</h4>

        <p>We've also seen that the balance point changes with speed. Ideally, we want to set our kit up so the balance point at cruising speed is where we want to stand.</p>
        <p>We'll call this the <i>Cruising Balance Point</i> </p>

        <div class = "diagrams">
          <img src = "Cruising_Balance_point.jpg" width="250px" height=200px" />
        </div>

        <p>Good beginner setups should ensure the <i>Balance Point</i> doesn't change that much with speed, to make things easier.</p>

        <div class="gap"></div>

        <h3>Adjusting the Cruising Balance Point</h3>

        <p>We want to adjust the <i>Cruising Balance Point</i> of the foil so that it matches where the rider wants to stand at their average cruising speed. There are a few ways to do this:</p>
        <ol>
          <li class="listmargin"> 
            <p>The simplest way is to move the foil in the track:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Moving the mast forward in the track moves the <i>Cruising Balance Point</i> forward. This means more NOSE UP rotation.</li>
              <li>Moving the mast back in the track moves the <i>Cruising Balance Point</i> back. This means more NOSE DOWN rotation.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class = "diagrams">
              <img src = "mast_track.jpg" width="200px" height="150px" />
            </div>
            <div ></div>
          </li>
          <li class="listmargin">A bigger stabiliser relative to the front foil will induce more nose-up rotation (moves <i>Cruising Balance Point</i> forward)</li>
          <li class="listmargin">A longer fuselage will induce more NOSE UP rotation (moves <i>Cruising Balance Point</i> forward)*</li>
          <li class="listmargin">
            <p>Shims on the stabiliser can change the <i>Cruising Balance Point</i> by reducing or increasing the downward lift of the stabiliser:</p>
            <div class="sections1">
            <div class = "diagrams">
              <img src = "shims.jpg" width="250px" height="300px" />
            </div>
            <div>
              <p>Positive shims reduce the amount of downward lift the stabiliser creates. This increases NOSE DOWN rotation.</p>
              <p>Negative shims increase the amount of downward lift the stabiliser creates. This increases NOSE UP rotation.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          </li>
          <li class="listmargin">Some foil brands also allow multiple fuselage to mast positions (Slingshot Hoverglide, Shinn). This can push the foil further foward or back in relation to the board.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>*This can depend on the brand, and which way the fuselage is extending. Typically they extend rearward though, increasing the leverage of the stabiliser.</p>

        

      <h3>Setting up board and foil</h3>

      <p>You may be thinking - rather than adjust the <i>Cruising Balance Point</i>, why not just stand further forward or back? - The answer is that you can do this, but it may put the rider in the wrong position on the board.</p>
      <p>Standing too far forward or back on the board will cause it to tip up or down slightly, adding drag and making it harder to get onto the foil. </p>

      <p>When not foiling, the rider needs to stand above the centre of buoyancy. If they aren't, then the nose or tail of the board will sink.</p>
      <div class = "diagrams">
        <img src = "man_board_float_neutral.jpg" width="250px" height=200px" />
      </div>

      <p>Once this position has been established, we then need to set the foil up so that the <i>Balance Point</i> lines up with the centre of buoyancy. This means the rider won't have to shift their weight once on the foil.</p>

      <div class = "diagrams">
        <img src = "man_board_buoyancy_perfect.jpg" width="250px" height=200px" />
      </div>

      <p>So, to set the board up:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Firstly, establish where the rider needs to stand off the foil. If using footstraps, you can then set these in this position</li>
        <li>Then, adjust the foil setup using the techniques above so that the <i>Cruising Balance Point</i>> is in the correct position</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Once properly set up, the rider can get onto the foil without adjusting their weight</p>

      <div class="gap"></div>

      <h3>Summary</h3>

      <p>If the board fails to rise as it accelerates, or the rider needs excessive backfoot pressure to keep the board in the air:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Move the mast forward in the foil box</li>
        <li>If this isn't enough, you can:
          <ul>
            <li>Add negative shims</li>
            <li>Use a bigger stabiliser</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>If the board nose flies up into the air uncontrollably , or the rider needs excessive front foot pressure to keep the board nose down:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Move the mast back in the foil box</li>
        <li>If this isn't enough, you can:
          <ul>
            <li>Add positive shims</li>
            <li>Use a smaller stabiliser</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h4>Beginner</h4>

      <p>As a beginner, with no foiling experience, you will want to know where to put the foil on your first few sessions</p>
      <p>A good guess is to have the centre of the front foil at the centre of where you will be standing</p>
      <div class = "diagrams">
        <img src = "beginner_foil_placement.jpg" width="250px" height=200px" />
      </div>

      <h4>Mixing Brands</h4>
      <p>Different brands have different foil geometries. Some have the mast right next to the front foil, others have it further back</p>
      <p>Consequently, their boards have their foil boxes in different positions. Some are quite far forward, others quite far back.</p>
      <p>This can mean certain foil and board brands are difficult to use together. It's worth checking first before mixing brands.</p>

      <p>Brands with forward boxes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Armstrong</li>
        <li>Naish 2020 gear</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Brands with rear boxes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Fanatic, especially 2021 gear</li>
      </ul>
